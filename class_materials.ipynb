So once you have Docker installed locally on your computer and the dev container extensions inside VS Code the development environment *should* build automagically and you'll be up and running right away.  \n",

Github makes this fairly easy with a sync button on the right side of your forked repo. These changes will then need to be pulled down to your local clone. Here is a overview of methods to do this from [GitHub:](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) including using the UI, the terminal and GitHub Client. Also below is a video overview of the process that includes how to handle commits you've already made to a forked repo that is out of date.  \n"

    "### Helpful Git/GitHub Commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Because I will be updating the repo that you clone and downloaded to your new Dev Container for the course you will add new content to your repo that won't be in mine or may change code files with the same name as the once I originally create. For example, so you added comments to this file for your own personal notes. Which is totally fine and probably even a smart thing to do. However, that would me that this file is different from the original, so when you went to pull the new content for the week there would be a merge error. The commands below can address this issue, in order. \n",
    "\n",
    "- git stash - Use this to save the uncommitted changes you've made locally for later. This command saves your local modifications away and reverts the working directory to match the HEAD commit so that it will give you a clean working directory.\n",
    "- git pull - Now you should be able to pull the new files into your directory. \n",
    "- git stash pop - When you are ready run this command and it will apply your changes and you'll have the new files. \n",
    "- Here's a link that provides more details [Stash and Stash Pop](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-apply-stash-in-git/)  \n",
    "\n",
    ":::{tip}\n",
    "It might be easier to rename the files from class or to create your own new files to avoid any conflicts. There's always a way to fix git issues without loosing anything, so don't worry if you're in a merge error death spiral, we can always save your files a do a rebase.\n",
