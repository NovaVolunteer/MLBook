        "**Regression** is a supervised learning task where the variable we are trying to predict is continuous.\n",

        "Some examples of continuous data include:\n",

        "In finance, regression can help predict stock prices, assess risk, forecast revenue, or understand how economic variables affect one another. For example, we might use regression to predict future stock returns based on historical data of interest rates, company earnings, or macroeconomic indicators.\n",

        "\n",
        "Regression analysis is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (i.e. the target) and one or more independent variables (i.e. the predictors or features). The goal of regression is to find an equation that best describes this relationship and enables the prediction of future outcomes based on new inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The overall general equation for a regression is:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "y = f(X) + \\epsilon\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "\n",
        "  + $y$ is the dependent variable, or target\n",
        "  + $X$ represents the independent variable(s), or features\n",
        "  + $f(X)$ is the function describing the relationship between $X$ and $y$ (this can be linear or non-linear)\n",

        "## Regression Models\n",
        "\n",
        "There are a few different types of regression models, each of which performs calculations in a slightly different way. In this section, we will discuss three popular regression models: linear regression, lasso regression, and ridge regression. Linear regression is the most basic form of regression model, while the others introduce a process called \"regularization\" which helps prevent overfitting, and improves the model's generalizability.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Linear Regression\n",
        "\n",
        "Ordinary least squares **linear regression** is the simplest form of regression, assuming a straight-line relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The goal is to minimize the difference between the actual and predicted values.\n",
        "\n",
        "When there is only one feature, the equation for a linear regression is as follows:\n",
        "$$\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "  + $\\beta_0$ is the intercept (the value of $y$ when $X=0$)\n",
        "  + $\\beta_1$ is the coefficient representing the slope of the line, which measures how much $y$ changes for a one-unit change in $X$\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "When there are multiple features, each feature and its corresponding coefficient is included in the regression equation:\n",

        "### Lasso Regression\n",
        "\n",
        "**Lasso regression** is a form of linear regression that includes an additional penalty term to control the magnitude of the coefficients. The Lasso method applies an L1 regularization process, which penalizes the absolute sum of the coefficients. This leads to feature selection, as some coefficients are reduced to zero, effectively excluding irrelevant features from the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Ridge Regression\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ridge regression** is similar to Lasso regression, but it applies an L2 regularization process, which penalizes the square of the coefficients. Instead of shrinking coefficients to zero like Lasso, Ridge regression forces coefficients to be small, but not zero. This method is useful when multicollinearity is present in the data.\n",

        "\n",
        "Each of these metrics provides a measure of how well a regression model explains the observed data.\n",

        "![Illustration of error terms, or residuals, in regression.](./../../images/residuals.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "NOTE: except for the R-squared score, where the goal is to achieve values as close to 1 as possible, the objective with the other metrics is to minimize their values.\n",

        "\n",
        "### R-Squared Score\n",
        "\n",
        "The **r-squared score**, otherwise known as the \"coefficient of determination\", measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables.\n",

        "  + $SST$ = Total Sum of Squares = $\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \\bar{y})^2$\n",
        "\n",

        "### Mean Absolute Error\n",
        "\n",
        "The **mean absolute error (MAE)** measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction (positive or negative). In other words, MAE is the average absolute difference between actual and predicted values.\n",

        "Like the MAE, RMSE provides an interpretable error metric in the same units as the target variable, making it useful for understanding the scale of the errors.
