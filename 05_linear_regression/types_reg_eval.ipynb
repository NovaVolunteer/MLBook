        "There are a few different types of regression models, each of which performs calculations in a slightly different way. In this section, we will discuss three popular regression models: linear regression, lasso regression, and ridge regression. Linear regression is the most basic form of regression model, while the others introduce a process called \"regularization\" which helps prevent overfitting, and improves the model's generalizability.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Linear Regression\n",
        "\n",
        "Ordinary least squares **linear regression** is the simplest form of regression, assuming a straight-line relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The goal is to minimize the difference between the actual and predicted values.\n",

        "**Lasso regression** is a form of linear regression that includes an additional penalty term to control the magnitude of the coefficients. The Lasso method applies an L1 regularization process, which penalizes the absolute sum of the coefficients. This leads to feature selection, as some coefficients are reduced to zero, effectively excluding irrelevant features from the model.\n",

        "### Ridge Regression\n",
        "\n",
        "**Ridge regression** is similar to Lasso regression, but it applies an L2 regularization process, which penalizes the square of the coefficients. Instead of shrinking coefficients to zero like Lasso, Ridge regression forces coefficients to be small, but not zero. This method is useful when multicollinearity is present in the data.\n",
